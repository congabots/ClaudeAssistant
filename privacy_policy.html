    <h1>Claude AI Weather Assistant Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 13th October 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Claude AI Weather Assistant Alexa Skill ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Alexa skill.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our skill collects the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Postcode and Country: We access your device's postcode and country to provide localized weather information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your postcode solely to retrieve weather data from a third-party weather API. This allows us to provide you with accurate, location-specific weather forecasts.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not store or retain your postcode or any other personal information. Your postcode is used only at the time of your weather request and is not saved or stored in any way.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not share your information with any third parties. The only external service we use is a weather API, which receives your postcode to return relevant weather data. This API does not receive any personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Protection</h2>
    <p>We do not store your data and during the brief moment your postcode is in use, care is taken to protect it.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>As we do not store your personal data, there is no data for you to access, modify, or delete. You can stop using our skill at any time if you no longer wish to share your postcode for weather requests.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: congabotsai@gmail.com</p>
